**Never lose your browser worksapce again.**  
A browser extension designed to save, organize, and restore tab sequences even from Private windows.

## 🚀 The Problem
When working in a browser especially **Private/Incognito** window, closing the browser means losing all your open tabs instantly. Browser history is disabled, so you can't restore them.

## ✅ The Solution
**Workspace Saver** allows you to snapshot your current tabs into a secure local storage. You can close the browser, come back days later, and restore the exact sequence of tabs with one click.
